## Introduction
Wetlands provide inportant ecosystem services to spciety, such as flood control, habitat for biodiversity, climate regulation and others. However, they are the most degraded ecoystem in the world, especially on agricultural landscapes; because    
1. they services they produce are not traded in markets    \
2. their services are public goods, that they are available to everyone in society   
3. society is not able to estimate the dollar values of wetlands and therefore are not able to justify the public funds they may spend tp conserve them.    

## Objective of the study   
To develop a meta-regression value function that will allow soceity to value wetlands.

## Methodology
We compare a Bayesian (linear and nonlinear) and frequentist random coefficient mixed models to estimate the meta-gression value.
